Synchronization is about protecting data integrity at the cost of performance.

In many cases, performance costs are minimal, but in extreme scenarios the
application could slow down significantly due to the inclusion of synchronization.

Being able to identify synchronization problems, including ways to improve
performance in synchronized multi-threaded environments, is a valuable skill in practice.
